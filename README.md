# movie-project

This project is created for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

The movie project is simple:

1. Create an class Movie in file media.py, that has attributes including title, storyline, poster image, and trailer url. Create method in movie that plays movie trailer.
2. Create a number of objects of type Movie in the entertainment_center.py file -- this is the movie library.
3. Use the fresh_tomatoes.py scaffold to create the front end.

In order to successfully run the movie project program the media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py files must all be in the same folder. Run the entertainment_center.py file in Python interpreter and it should open the default web browser with the newly created website. The fresh_tomatoes file effectively creates an HTML file, which will then exist in the same directory as the rest of the files, and can be opened without running the Python files in the future.
